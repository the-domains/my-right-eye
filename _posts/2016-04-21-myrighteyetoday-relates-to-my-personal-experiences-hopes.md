description: "MyRightEye.Today relates to my personal experiences, hopes, dreams and progress with the condition Amblyopia and Strabismus (turn in the eye), in my case the right eye. Amblyopia is a condition where the brain ignores the weaker eye at an early age and the child's brain never learns depth perception or 3D. My hope with this website, is to bring some awareness to the symptom, the problems we face which are many and varied and always relatively unnoticed by most - or if they are noticed they just assume we are clumsy or have bad spacial judgement (we do, very much).
